== Share with Pastie, IntelliJ IDEA plugin ==

This plugin allows to share selected code fragment using http://pastie.org service.
It automatically detects language of selected fragment and then copies link to shared code into your clipboard.
Sent code is marked as private so it is not visible publicly, only through the link.

Currently most languages connected with Java/JavaEE development are supported. If you find any language missing,
please contact with author.

Plugin can be downloaded from [http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?idea&id=6267 IDEA Plugin Repository]
or simply using File -> Settings -> Plugins inside your favorite IDE.
